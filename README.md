## Quantum sequence alignment 
Artira Sakar developed Quantum sequence alignment. The code only provided an example of this method using Qiskit. For a detailed explanation and deeper understanding of this approach, you can refer to the original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05563, which offers a comprehensive insight into the method and its underlying concept.


## Prerequisites: 
Install Python3 and Qiskit

Once the prerequisites are installed, then you can run the quantum sequence alignment by the following command,

python3 sequence_alignment.py
